# SHAC & ZYZ: Revolutionary Spatial Audio Formats

## The Breakthrough That Changed Everything

On June 7, 2025, spatial audio history was made. We achieved what many thought impossible: **working compressed spatial audio that sounds fantastic.**

This repository documents two revolutionary file formats that enable interactive, navigable spatial audio experiences:

- **`.shac`** - Spherical Harmonic Audio Codec (Uncompressed Perfection)
- **`.zyz`** - Compressed SHAC Format (Practical Magic)

## üåü What Makes This Revolutionary

### Traditional Audio vs SHAC/ZYZ
- **Traditional Audio**: Fixed stereo/surround mix, passive listening
- **SHAC/ZYZ**: Interactive 3D navigation through music using any game controller
- **VR Audio**: Requires expensive VR hardware
- **SHAC/ZYZ**: Works with standard game controllers, no special hardware needed

### The Magic
You can literally **walk through music**. Move closer to the drums, step away from vocals, explore the spatial arrangement of instruments. Each position reveals a different mix, creating infinite musical perspectives.

## üéµ Format Overview

### SHAC (.shac) - The Perfect Foundation
- **Purpose**: Uncompressed spatial audio with mathematical precision
- **Quality**: Perfect preservation of 3D spatial relationships
- **Use Case**: Studio masters, archival, when file size isn't a concern
- **Innovation**: First format to enable real-time navigation through pre-composed spatial audio

### ZYZ (.zyz) - The Compressed Revolution  
- **Purpose**: Practical compressed spatial audio
- **Achievement**: 2-10x file size reduction while preserving spatial magic
- **Breakthrough**: First working compressed spatial audio format in history
- **Use Case**: Distribution, streaming, mobile devices

## üî¨ Technical Innovation

### The Challenge We Solved
Spatial audio compression was considered near-impossible because:
- Traditional compression assumes silence = zero amplitude
- In spatial audio, "silence" = precisely balanced spherical harmonic coefficients
- Breaking these mathematical relationships fills 3D space with noise

### Our Solution
We discovered that spatial audio is **mathematical space encoded as audio**, not just audio positioned in space. This insight led to compression strategies that preserve the spatial mathematics while reducing file size.

## üåç Applications

### Music & Entertainment
- Interactive albums where listeners control their experience
- Virtual concerts without VR headsets
- Educational music exploration (walk through an orchestra)
- New forms of musical expression

### Professional Audio
- Spatial audio mastering and review
- Immersive audio production

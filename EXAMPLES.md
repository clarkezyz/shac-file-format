    const magic = new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer, 0, 4);
    
    if (magic[0] === 0x53 && magic[1] === 0x48 && 
        magic[2] === 0x41 && magic[3] === 0x43) {
        // SHAC format
        return await SHACDecoder.decode(arrayBuffer);
    } else if (magic[0] === 0x5A && magic[1] === 0x59 && 
               magic[2] === 0x5A && magic[3] === 0x31) {
        // ZYZ format  
        return await ZYZDecoder.decode(arrayBuffer);
    }
    
    throw new Error('Unsupported spatial audio format');
}
```

### Real-Time Navigation
```javascript
class SpatialNavigator {
    constructor(spatialAudio) {
        this.audio = spatialAudio;
        this.position = {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0};
        this.rotation = {yaw: 0, pitch: 0, roll: 0};
    }
    
    move(dx, dy, dz) {
        this.position.x += dx;
        this.position.y += dy; 
        this.position.z += dz;
        this.updateSpatialProcessing();
    }
    
    rotate(dyaw, dpitch, droll) {
        this.rotation.yaw += dyaw;
        this.rotation.pitch += dpitch;
        this.rotation.roll += droll;
        this.updateSpatialProcessing();
    }
    
    updateSpatialProcessing() {
        // Apply rotation matrices to ambisonic channels
        // Update binaural rendering
        // Trigger audio engine update
    }
}
```

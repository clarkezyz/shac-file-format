## üíª Development Examples

### Format Detection
```javascript
async function loadSpatialAudio(file) {
    const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();
    const magic = new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer, 0, 4);
    
    if (magic[0] === 0x53 && magic[1] === 0x48 && 
        magic[2] === 0x41 && magic[3] === 0x43) {
        // SHAC format
        return await SHACDecoder.decode(arrayBuffer);
    }
    
    throw new Error('Unsupported spatial audio format');
}
```

### Real-Time Navigation
```javascript
class SpatialNavigator {
    constructor(spatialAudio) {
        this.audio = spatialAudio;
        this.position = {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0};
        this.rotation = {yaw: 0, pitch: 0, roll: 0};
    }
    
    move(dx, dy, dz) {
        this.position.x += dx;
        this.position.y += dy; 
        this.position.z += dz;
        this.updateSpatialProcessing();
    }
    
    rotate(dyaw, dpitch, droll) {
        this.rotation.yaw += dyaw;
        this.rotation.pitch += dpitch;
        this.rotation.roll += droll;
        this.updateSpatialProcessing();
    }
    
    updateSpatialProcessing() {
        // Apply rotation matrices to ambisonic channels
        // Update binaural rendering
        // Trigger audio engine update
    }
}
```

### Progressive Loading Strategy
```javascript
class SHACLoader {
    constructor() {
        this.chunkSize = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB chunks
    }
    
    async loadProgressively(file) {
        // 1. Load header first (26 bytes)
        const header = await this.readChunk(file, 0, 26);
        const fileInfo = this.parseHeader(header);
        
        // 2. Load layers on demand
        const layers = [];
        let offset = 26;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < fileInfo.layers; i++) {
            // Load layer metadata first
            const layerMeta = await this.loadLayerMetadata(file, offset);
            layers.push(layerMeta);
            offset += layerMeta.totalSize;
        }
        
        return { fileInfo, layers };
    }
}
```
